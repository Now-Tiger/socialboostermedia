# Social Booster Media App

- This is a simple crud application built with **NextJS**, **Python(django)** & **PostgreSQL**. This app is my submission to social booster media's take-home assessment.
- In this readme file first you'll find application setup instructions, then I have given information about the backend (APIs) that I have built and used i.e. third party apis.

# App set up

First clone this repository in your system.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Now-Tiger/socialboostermedia.git
```

Change directory.

```bash
cd socialboostermedia
```

You'll see two folders `frontend` & `backend`. The frontend is simple NextJS project, although the backend is **dockerized** application. First let's setup the backend.

## Backend

Follow below steps one by one

#### Build docker images

```bash
docker compose build
```

#### Pull Postgres image

For some reasons `docker-compose.yml` is not able to full postgres image. You'll have to enter below command. **This is an important step**

```bash
docker pull postgres:15.5-alpine
```

#### Start containers

Below command runs the containers in the background.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To check if the containers are running, you can use:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

#### Django app logs

```bash
docker logs -f backend-web-1 --tail 50
```

#### Postgres checkup

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U postgresuser -d sbmdb
```

## Frontend

Change directory into frontend and follow below steps one by one. This starts the frontend locally.

```Bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

# APIs
The backend has two built in APIs. One third party api in used by the frontend only.
1. `http://localhost:8000/` : root API, also used as the health check API.
2. `http://localhost:8000/user-analytics` : Returns the data from `user_analytics` table from the `sbmdb` Postgres database.
3. `https://data-api.coindesk.com/index/cc/v1/latest/tick?market=cadli&instruments=BTC-USD,ETH-USD&apply_mapping=true` : This is a **Third-Party** API used to fetch crypto data. 

# Frontend App structure
- On startup you have a Navbar with few options, and a card that displays two buttons. 
- `Fetch data` button and `Dashboard` navbar item redirects you the `../analytics` page. 
- `Add data` button and `App` navbar item redirects you to the `../app` page.

#### Analytics page
- Analytics page has displays three cards/charts.
- First card, displaying vertical bar chart, displays the data returned by backend API call i.e. `http://localhost:8000/user-analytics/`
- Second card, displaying horizontal bar chart, shows static data (No API call)
- Third & last card, displays area chart, shows data from **Third-party** [crypto market data API](https://developers.coindesk.com/documentation/data-api/index_cc_v1_latest_tick)

#### App page
- On app page, you have a form. After adding the data you can see that data on the first bar chart displayed on the Analytics page.
- The form data is sent to `http://localhost:8000/user-analytics` API using `POST` method, on successful API call the API returns the data that is being sent via API and that data can be displayed on Analytics page.
- To see this in action, add larger quantities/numbers for desktop or mobile fields for the month of January 2024.
